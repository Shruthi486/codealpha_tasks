Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning and deep learning projects built during my internship at **CodeAlpha**. Each project showcases real-world applications of AI, using modern tools and industry practices.

Explore how I approached credit risk modeling, emotion recognition from speech, and image classification using CNNs.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 💳 Credit Scoring Model
A machine learning model that evaluates the creditworthiness of individuals based on financial and demographic data.

📄 File: [`credit_scoring_model/credit_scoring_model.ipynb`](credit_scoring_model/credit_scoring_model.ipynb)

### 2. 🗣️ Emotion Speech Recognition
A speech recognition model that classifies emotions from audio input using signal processing and machine learning techniques.
