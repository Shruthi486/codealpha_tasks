![CodeAlpha Internship](https://img.shields.io/badge/Internship-CodeAlpha-blueviolet)

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning and deep learning projects built during my internship at **CodeAlpha**. Each project showcases real-world applications of AI, using modern tools and industry practices.

Explore how I approached credit risk modeling, emotion recognition from speech, and image classification using CNNs.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 💳 Credit Scoring Model
A machine learning model that evaluates the creditworthiness of individuals based on financial and demographic data.

📄 File: `credit scoring model.ipynb`

### 2. 🗣️ Emotion Speech Recognition
A speech recognition model that classifies emotions from audio input using signal processing and machine learning techniques.

📄 File: `emotion speech recognition.ipynb`

### 3. 🔤 CNN for Handwritten Alphabets
A deep learning CNN-based project that classifies handwritten alphabet characters from image data.

📄 File: `cnn-for-handwritten-alphabets.ipynb`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
